I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Neuroengineering Lab of ULiège](https://www.neuroengineering.uliege.be/) under the supervision of [Guillaume Drion](https://sites.google.com/site/gdrion25/) at the [University of Liège](https://www.uliege.be) in Belgium. I am interested in computational neuroscience and neuromorphic system design. Previously, I got my PhD in 2025 and I graduated biomedical engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) in 2021 both at the University of Liège.
